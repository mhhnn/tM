          ThreatMatic&trade; is a potent solution for a smart zero-trust edge and rapid malware counter measures with unparalleled visibility and control.

        <p class="mb-6">
          Today's cyber defenses are typically constructed with a perimeter focus where the security is built from outside-in, and this is the main reason why we have so many security breaches that cause massive loss of data, trust and productivity, and are expensive to mitigate. We have taken a novel approach to building an end point focused zero-trust solution that is guided by simplicity of deployment with ultra low-latency policy updates for an impermeable Zero-Trust edge.
