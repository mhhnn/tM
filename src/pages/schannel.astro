          ThreatMatic S/Channel is a lightning quick secure channel to your private and public clouds and data centers. It's both ephemeral and encrypted, with the latest ciphers and highly customizable with ThreatMatic security policies.

        <p class="mb-6">
          You protect only the flows and conversations you choose, unwind the complexity and sluggish performance of traditional VPN, while you unleash your workforce and free them to connect to your data: uncompromising confidentiality and blazing performance at a fraction of the cost.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Our built-in metrics and bandwidth management (QoS) capabilities set us apart from the competition, as does multi-factor authentication and short key lifetimes for maximum peace of mind. It's engineered for the modern world with auto-scaling and high-availability fused into our design.
        </p>

          S/Channel also functions as a granular, "app level traffic director" to route traffic to security pipelines and NAT to ensure deep inspection and address obfuscation, in concert with IAM, DLP, XDR and logging services.
